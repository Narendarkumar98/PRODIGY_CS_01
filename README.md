# Caesar Cipher Implementation in Python

This repository contains a Python implementation of the Caesar Cipher, a simple encryption technique where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number of positions down the alphabet.

## Features

- **Encrypt and Decrypt**: The script allows you to both encrypt and decrypt messages using the Caesar Cipher.
- **Customizable Shift**: Users can specify the shift value to customize the encryption.
- **Handles Upper and Lower Case**: The script processes both uppercase and lowercase letters while leaving non-alphabetic characters unchanged.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   https://github.com/Narendarkumar98/PRODIGY_CS_01.git


### Usage

1. **Running the Script**

   You can run the script directly to encrypt or decrypt a message.

   python caesar_cipher.py
